So, I wanted to make one of these [flash cut](https://eyecannndy.com/technique/flash-cut)-style videos, and I wanted a way to overlay a photo on top of the camera. I searched for an app, and all I could find were sketchy apps with like three reviews and paid apps with premium features. Why wasn't there something simple? Or even a web version?

This app allows you to overlay a photo, and take and save photos. It's super simple, but works.

The app functions as a PWA. If you don't know what that is... you're in for a treat. A PWA is a Progressive Web Application - kind of like a website, but it also works as an app. This means that the website can be downloaded as an app, and functions like an app on an iPhone or an Android Device (in theory, I haven't tested).

## Instalation (On iOS)

Go to [the website](https://overlaycam.vercel.app/) on Safari, click on the share button, then scroll down and click `Add to Home Screen` - it's a long button below `Find on Page` and above `Markup`. Then, click `Add` in the top right. The app should now be on your home screen. It might need to load for a few seconds when you first open it.

Note: As of 6/28, this for some reason does not work anymore. It works completely fine on Safari, but once it's on your home screen, it doesn't work anymore. I can't figure it out.
